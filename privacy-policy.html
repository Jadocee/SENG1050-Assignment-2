            <h1>Privacy Policy of Jim'sCars.com</h1>
            <p>- Updated October, 2021</p>
            <p>
                This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the Jim's Cars website,

            </p>
            <p>
                Jim's Cars is committed to providing you with the best possible customer service experience.
                Jim's Cars is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which sets out a number of principles concerning
                the privacy of individuals.
            </p>
            <h2>Collection of your personal information</h2>
            <p>
                There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal information, however,
                for access to future Jim's Cars customer support features you are required to submit personally
                identifiable information. This may include but not limited to a unique username and password, or provide
                sensitive information in the recovery of your lost password.
            </p>
            <h2>Sharing of your personal information</h2>
            <p>
                We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not limited
                to handling customer support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight shipping. Those
                companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service.
                Jim's Cars takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by confidentiality and
                privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.
            </p>
            <h2>Use of your personal information</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
                From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed
                in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for
                these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change forward will adhere to our
                updated practices.
